# DAGagramR - Causal Diagrams Visualization shiny app <img src="productionDAGshiny/www/DAGgram-Logo.png" align="right" width="80" />

This shiny app has been built to faciliate causal reasoning. With this tool, users can build causal diagrams, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), to visually represent assumptions about causal relationships between variables. 

This app has been developed by members of [Core Clinical Sciences](https://www.coreclinicalsciences.com)

## User Guide 

Once the app is running, 
- You can name the `Treatment` and `Response` nodes that will pop up in the tool

- Choose if the causal question of interest is related to transportability analysis or not 

      - Transportability analysis option will provide `Treatment`,  `Response`, and `Participation` nodes
      
      - Other (non-transportability analysis) option will provide `Treatment` and `Response` nodes without the `Participation` node
      
- You can add notes with the `Add Nodes` button. 

- While viewing the current nodes, edit their connections (parents and children) and whether they are measured or unmeasured. 

- Once your relationships are in place you can check for open back door paths and condition on nodes to eliminate these paths.
